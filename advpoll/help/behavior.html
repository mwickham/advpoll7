        <h1>Advanced Poll Voting Behavior</h1>
        <p>Advanced poll offers two default behaviors and two additional behaviors 
            when Advanced Ranking Poll is enabled.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Approval</dt>
            <dd>Approval voting works much like the core Drupal poll with the addition of the ability 
            to select more than one option.  For instance, if a poll has five choices and a user is allowed
            to select three, their vote only counts once but each selection receives a fraction of that vote.
            For more information see 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Approval Voting</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Pooled</dt>
            <dd>Assuming a multiple choice poll, each vote by the same user carries the same weight. As in
            the above example, if there are five choices and the user can select three, the results will
            count each selection as a separate vote.</dd>
            <dt>Borda Count</dt>
            <dd>Borda count is made available by installing the Advanced Ranking Poll module. This
            style of voting assumes a ranked preference.  For instance, if there are five candidates 
            and the user is allowed to choose and rank their top three, the first candidate receives
            5 points, the second 4 and the third 3. For more information see
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Borda Count</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Instant-runnoff Voting</dt>
            <dd>Instant Run-off is also made available by installing the Advanced Ranking Poll module. 
                Voters are allowed to rank their preferences with each candidate receiving more points for
                a higher ranking.  The candidate with the highest overall ranking in a given round is 
                declared the winner. For more information see
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Instant-runoff Count</a>.
            </dd>            
        </dl>
        
        <p>Note that for ranking polls, choices are limited to 10 to enable voting to still work
        when javascript is turned off.</p>
